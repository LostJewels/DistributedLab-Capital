# DistributedLab-Capital
A bigger program for a DistributedLab challenge. Now has rudimentary protection against inputs with incorrect typings, I think it breaks if you input the wrong amount of stuff but again... it works if you follow the instructions.

Input the max number of laptops. Enter. Punch in the starting capital. Enter. Then put in the prices of laptops (separated by spaces) that you bought (there's a check for if you bought laptops for more cash than you had). Enter. Put in the profits (also separated by spaces). Enter. And there you go, you got the capital at the end of summer (the calculation is comically rudimentary).

Took me like 2 hours until I gave up and did it the easy way.
